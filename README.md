#CBasics
So basically I made this repository so anyone who has some interest in learning programming in C can have like a base to work with.
I reccomend you use Dev-CPP which you can download from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/
Dev-CPP is a very good development tool which you can use to develop C and C++ applications
I'll try to update this repository weekly but i promise nothing. 
Alternative for Dev-CPP is Visual Studio Code but it requires a bit more work to get running. VS download: https://code.visualstudio.com
So anyway, be sure to come back and check for updates.
